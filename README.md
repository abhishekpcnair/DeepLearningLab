# Deep Learning Lab

A series of Deep Learning exercises to practice with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Professor: [Elisa Ricci](http://elisaricci.eu/)

Lab Instructors:
  * [Massimiliano Mancini](https://mancinimassimiliano.github.io/) (Email: mancini@fbk.eu)
  * [Subhankar Roy](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=YfzgrDYAAAAJ&hl=en) (Email: subhankar.roy@unitn.it)

## Introduction
This is the official github webpage of the Deep Learning course for the academic year 2018/19 taught at University of Trento by Prof. Elisa Ricci. Hands-on experience will be provided for the concepts taught during the lectures. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) will be used to run the codes in GPU environment.

N.B. Lab related queries should be directed to the Lab instructors.
